Gluepy's security policies
==========================

Gluepy's development team is strongly committed to responsible
reporting and disclosure of security-related issues. As such, we've
adopted and follow a set of policies which conform to that ideal and
are geared toward allowing us to deliver timely security updates to
the official distribution of Gluepy, as well as to third-party
distributions.

Reporting security issues
=========================

**Short version: please report security issues by emailing
security@gluepy.com**.

Most normal bugs in Gluepy are reported to `our public Trac instance`_, but
due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask that they **not** be
publicly reported in this fashion.

Instead, if you believe you've found something in Gluepy which has security
implications, please send a description of the issue via email to
``security@gluepy.com``. Mail sent to that address reaches the `security
team <https://www.gluepy.com/foundation/teams/#security-team>`_.

Once you've submitted an issue via email, you should receive an acknowledgment
from a member of the security team within 48 hours, and depending on the
action to be taken, you may receive further followup emails.
