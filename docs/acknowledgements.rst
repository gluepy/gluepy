The core contributing team to Gluepy have a background from other software engineering disciplines such web development,
and you will see many aspects of the Gluepy framework that pulls in a lot of concepts and inspiration from existing work
from other parts of the software engineering world, and make it available in a framework targetting Data Engineers,
Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers.

One key inspiration has been `Django Framework <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ including some of the naming conventions,
structure of repository, structure of their excellent documentation and pluggable, lazily evaluated backend classes such as
the :ref:`topic_data`.
