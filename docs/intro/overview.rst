==================
Gluepy at a glance
==================

Because Gluepy was developed in a fast-paced newsroom environment, it was
designed to make common web development tasks fast and easy. Here's an informal
overview of how to write a database-driven web app with Gluepy.

The goal of this document is to give you enough technical specifics to
understand how Gluepy works, but this isn't intended to be a tutorial or
reference -- but we've got both! When you're ready to start a project, you can
:doc:`start with the tutorial </intro/tutorial01>` or :doc:`dive right into more
detailed documentation </topics/index>`.
