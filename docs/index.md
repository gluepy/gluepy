## How the documentation is organized

Gluepy contains a lot of documentation that is structured in a way that range from
high level concepts all the way down to reference documentation that explain each specific
feature.

* [Tutorials]({% link pages/tutorials/index.md %}) contain step by step
  instructions that help you get started with a small demo project. It tries to avoid advanced
  topics and might not include every feature that you could use in a production project.
* [Topic guides]({% link pages/topics/index.md %}) include a high level description
  of a topic or concept of the framework. It is a great place to start to get a basic understanding
  of a feature before you drill down into the reference documentation.
* [Reference guides]({% link pages/reference/index.md %}) contain technical reference for
  the class API's and features of Gluepy. It is on a more detailed and low level than topic guides.
