I think I've found a security problem! What should I do?
========================================================

If you think you've found a security problem with Gluepy, please send a message
to marcuslind90@gmail.com.

Due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask that if you think you
have found a security problem, *please* don't post a message on the forum, IRC,
or one of the public mailing lists. Gluepy has a
:ref:`policy for handling security issues <reporting-security-issues>`;
while a defect is outstanding, we would like to minimize any damage that
could be inflicted through public knowledge of that defect.
