==========================
Gluepy's security policies
==========================

Gluepy's development team is strongly committed to responsible
reporting and disclosure of security-related issues. As such, we've
adopted and follow a set of policies which conform to that ideal and
are geared toward allowing us to deliver timely security updates to
the official distribution of Gluepy, as well as to third-party
distributions.

Reporting security issues
=========================

**Short version: please report security issues by emailing
marcuslind90@gmail.com**.

Most normal bugs in Gluepy are reported to `issue tracker <https://github.com/gluepy/gluepy/issues>`_, but
due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask that they **not** be
publicly reported in this fashion.

Instead, if you believe you've found something in Gluepy which has security
implications, please send a description of the issue via email to
``marcuslind90@gmail.com``.
