Otherwise, before reporting a bug or requesting a new feature on the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/gluepy/gluepy/issues>`_, consider these points:

* Check that someone hasn't already filed the bug or feature request by
  `searching`_ or running `custom queries`_ in the issue tracker.

Reporting bugs
==============

Well-written bug reports are *incredibly* helpful. However, there's a certain
amount of overhead involved in working with any bug tracking system so your
help in keeping our issue tracker as useful as possible is appreciated. In
particular:

* **Do** read the :doc:`FAQ </faq/index>` to see if your issue might
  be a well-known question.

* **Do** write complete, reproducible, specific bug reports. You must
  include a clear, concise description of the problem, and a set of
  instructions for replicating it. Add as much debug information as you can:
  code snippets, test cases, exception backtraces, screenshots, etc. A nice
  small test case is the best way to report a bug, as it gives us a
  helpful way to confirm the bug quickly.
